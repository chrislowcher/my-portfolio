A few thousand downloads and inclusion in a popular nexus mod collection. </p><p class="mt-8"> My next mod was not as popular, even though I think it&#39;s even better! It is a weapon randomizer that selects a new random weapon when you get a kill, and it&#39;s entirely configurable through the game&#39;s native UI settings. To this day it is my favorite way to play the game.</p></div></div><div class="mt-10 flex items-center gap-4"><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/profile/clowch/mods" target="_blank" class="rounded-md bg-cyber-yellow-600 px-3.5 py-2.5 text-sm font-semibold text-gray-900 shadow-xs hover:bg-cyber-yellow-500 focus-visible:outline-2 focus-visible:outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-cyber-yellow-600 dark:bg-cyber-yellow-500 dark:hover:bg-cyber-yellow-400 dark:focus-visible:outline-cyber-yellow-500">Check out my mods</a><a href="https://wiki.redmodding.org/cyberpunk-2077-modding" class="text-md/6 font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white cursor-pointer">Learn more <span aria-hidden="true">→</span></a></div></div></div><div class="relative overflow-hidden pt-16 lg:pt-20"><div class="mx-auto max-w-7xl px-6 lg:px-8"><div class="flex justify-center"><img class="mb-[-12%] rounded-xl shadow-2xl ring-2 ring-gray-900/10 shadow-xl ring-white/10" src="~/assets/images/slomopromo.png" alt="Nexus Mods Site"></div></div></div></div>',1)])])):f("",!0)])])])}}});export{$ as default};
